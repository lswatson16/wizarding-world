# Challenges and Wins

Making UI/UX decisions was the biggest challenge. I wanted to make sure the site wasn't confusing and navigation between the pages was smooth. I decided to hide the filter drop down menus and search bar on page load, then show only one at a time after a user clicks a button. 

# Features

## Filter

There are 3 drop down down menus that allow the user to filter through the list of Harry Potter characters. You can filter by house, ancestry/origin, students and staff.
## Search

A user can type into the controlled form to find a character by their name. You can type in as many characters as you like to start searching for your favorite Harry Potter character.

## Character Details

After filtering and searching for your favorite character, you can now select on a character that you want to find out more information on. After maming your selection, you will be navigated to a chracater details page. Here you can view details like the actor's name and type of wood found in the wizard's wand.
